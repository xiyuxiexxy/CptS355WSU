c++ object

contains
data
methods

create a new object say new

1. memory allocation

Q: how much memory? need for method code?

for non-virual nethods we don't need per object information about where the code is
that is implicit in the class information about the object



virual method
can be over-ridden
in an inheriting class


do we have to have a point to each virtual methods?
no, same class has same set of virtual methods

A object
1 pointer  -> vtable for the class
data		m1			-> code for m1
		m2			->


when B inherits from A

B object

1 pointer -> B's vtable  
A data   <- exactly like a for position of each .a (correct offset from the beginning the object)
B data


B's vtable
copy of A vtable <- if B overrides A's methods, its replaces in A part of B's vtable
B-vtable addtion


problem for multiple inheritant


note:
1. non virtual methods are not the vtable
2. pure virtual methods: always in vtable
3. abstract class is a class with at least one pure virtual methods
4. destructor: virtual destructor
